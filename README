*********************************************************************************
* NOTE: This kernel is for JB 4.1.1 and 4.2.2 but for now the phone won't boot. *
* It gets stuck after boot logo with following errors in logcat:                *
*                                                                               *
* E/IMGSRV  (  104): :0: OpenServices: PVRSRVBridgeCall failed.                 *
* E/IMGSRV  (  104): :0: PVRSRVConnect: Unable to open connection.              *
* E/IMGSRV  (  104): :0: PVRSRVBridgeCall: Failed to access device.             *

In order to get kernel compilation working, make sure you follow one of these steps:

- You have 3 folders: kernel, mediatek and toolchain.
  - kernel folder is the basic one, with the linux kernel sources.
  - mediatek folder contains dependences that are necessary to build for MTK platform.
  - toolchain folder contains the appropriate cross-compiler.


- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder.
  There is a script called build.sh.
  That is the interface you will use to build device kernel.

- To begin with the build process run script with command:
  ./build.sh newmann1 (normal compilation)
  or
  ./build.sh newmann1 verbose (verbose compilation)

  Once finished, you will find:
  -- the new kernel file in root folder ./build_result/kernel/kernel
  -- the compiled modules in root folder ./build_result/modules/*.ko


- To perform a clean build run command:
  ./build.sh newmann1 clean
  or even better
  ./build.sh newmann1 mrproper


- Create new boot.img:
  -- Get stock boot.img for device and unpack it.
  -- Repack the stock ramdisk (from stock boot.img) with the new generated kernel file.
